4/3 {
YayReplay css is not loading. It worked once, added to it, now doesn't work. Didn't change path.
}

4/4 {
YayReplay css path was still not right. Fixed. Also removed a duplicate css file.
}

4/6 {
JS test didn't work. Chrome said var target was null, which means querySelector() didn't work. Will check querySelector() on MDN or else use different tutorial.
}

4/7{
JS test worked. Trying to set up Babel so simple import statement will work in js file. Could use the ES5 version like require(), but Tim said it's cooler and should be done.

Progress: "npm run build" command completed successfully.
At: https://babeljs.io/setup#installation step 4 (using CLI).

Note: May also be helpful to finish guide at https://wesbos.com/javascript-modules/

Note: Tim also recommends Webpack, but idk if necessary.
}

4/8{
still get "Uncaught SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module". SO said just add "type": "module" to package.json but that didn't fix it.
}

4/9{
realized the Babel setup guide wasn't completed yet. Made .babelrc to enable the preset-env, but that also didn't work. Maybe will have to add a start script like SO says here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58805918/why-node-js-ignores-the-type-setting-in-the-package-json-file. That didn't work either.

Tim says it's too hard to troubleshoot, just use old style.
}

4/10{
reverted repo and noticed node_modules was tiny because untracked. Will just delete node_modules and reinstall node and Papaparse. Deleted node_modules but still says I have npm installed globally. Don't remember how to install npm locally
}

4/11{
working commit 1565afc copied all of papaparse/ into js/ and used script tag in html to load js/papaparse/papaparse.min.js. Since people say not to use the actual path for security, will look into dep-linker later.

Progress: time to fix the csv writerow bug :). Once there is something consistent to upload, need to either copy the whole database to the GitHub Pages folder or change the path in the step that saves to csv, so the database is just kept in the GP folder instead of the scraper folder.
}

4/14{
fixed writerow bug in scraper and also got scraper.py to write to the database in YayReplay's assets folder. Ready to parse.

File paths in js files are relative to the html file their script tag is in. That would have taken a while without Tim.

Tim also helped with callback function. Better to pass a reference to the function parse(functionName) instead of calling it from inside like parse(functionName(data)). Yes, Papaparse secretly passes results as an argument to functionName when it calls back. The other examples with paretheses were all anonymous, which is why that worked.

It's alive for the first time, showing scraped data on the web page.

Progress: parsedObject.data returns array of rows. For some reason, it gets an extra null row, so might work around for now by adding a check if the row is null before creating its element. ParsedObject.errors is showing FieldMismatch: TooFewFields. Fixed by adding a config argument.

New progress: use f12 to set equal width either with max-width % or max-width px or (on container) justify-content space-evenly. Then, add a function to print the headers. Then, add something to set the element of links to anchors instead of div after main loop (or at worst use if in main loop).
}

4/15{
setting margin-right px on the child divs works.

Progress: headers, anchors should link and say "link to Play page", don't print id (done).
}
