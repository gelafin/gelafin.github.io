            Carara is a pre-alpha card game that you can play in real life. It
            was made using <a target="_blank" href="https://godotengine.org/">
            Godot, an open-source game engine</a>, in its proprietary python-like
            language, GDscript.

            Note: You may have to left-click on the game board to use arrow key
            movement. Will fix later
